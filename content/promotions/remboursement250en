The financial assistance program, See Better to Succeed, offers a reimbursement of $250 following the purchase of eyeglasses or contact lenses for any child under the age of 18. This amount is fixed: it does not vary with the cost of your purchase. Only purchases made as of September 1, 2019 from a merchant in Québec are eligible. The reimbursement is granted only for the purchase of eyeglasses or contact lenses prescribed by a professional for vision correction.
